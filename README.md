**Color Based Image Processing Techniques to Detect
Oxide Film during Welding**

Abstract - From naval to aerospace and industry to
household, everywhere the necessity of aluminum is felt. But
oxide film can be formed on this metal and its alloys during
casting or welding due to high affinity of aluminum for
oxygen. This phenomenon can further lead to porosity which
is a vital defect. Visual inspection is not sufficient due to
different human constraints. So, many image processing
techniques have been developed. For better welding, we
propose here two useful and efficient techniques. Unlike most
of the previous techniques, our proposed techniques are color
based processing. In this manuscript, our main goal is to
detect oxide film and we show that the task is successfully
done by our methods.
